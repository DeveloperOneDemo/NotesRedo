IO in java
----------
two types of streams
---------------------
1) character based streams - data flows as characters

	Reader			Writer
	   FileReader		   FileWriter
   	   BufferedReader	   
	   InputStreamReader	

2) byte based streams - data flows as bytes
	InputStream		OutputStream
	   FileInputStream	    FileOUtputStream
	   DataInputStream	    DataOutputStream


- Reader, Writer, InputStream and OutputStream are abstract classes
- streams are unidirectional
