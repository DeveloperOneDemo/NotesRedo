IO in java
----------
two types of streams
---------------------
1) character based streams - data flows as characters

	Reader			Writer
	   FileReader		   FileWriter
   	   BufferedReader	   
	   InputStreamReader	

2) byte based streams - data flows as bytes
	InputStream		OutputStream
	   FileInputStream	    FileOUtputStream
	   DataInputStream	    DataOutputStream
	   ObjectInputStream	    ObjectOutputStream

- Reader, Writer, InputStream and OutputStream are abstract classes
- streams are unidirectional

Serialization/ Deserialization
-------------------------------
	- Any object which is persisted should be serialized and persisted
	- A serialized object should be deserialized when it is read back
	- ObjectOutputStream helps to Serialize the object
	- ObjectInputStream helps to deserialize the object

assignments
-----------

1) redo the demo programs using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
2) copy the contents of a file to another file
3) get input from the user and encrypt the data and write to a file
4) read the encrypted data from the file , decrypt it and print it on the console
5) redo the serilization and deserialization demo using a different class
