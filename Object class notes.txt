Object 
A class implicitly extends Object
Object is the parent class of A
class A{

	A(){
		// super(); // this is implicitly injected by the compiler if super() is not provided
		System.out.println("in A");
	}
}

class B extends A{

	// 2nd solution 
	B(){
	}

	B(int mark){
		// super(); // this is implicitly injected by the compiler if super() is not provided
		mark = 100;
		System.out.println("in B");
	}
}

class C extends B{

	C(){
		// super(); // this is implicitly injected by the compiler if super() is not provided
		// 1st solution
		//super(50);
		
		System.out.println("in C");
	}
}

class Demo{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		// question is - in which order are the constructors called? C B A
		// or which class constructor is called first?
		C c = new C();
