Forms in Angular - 2 types of forms 
----------------
1) Template driven Form
	- this is what we worked in the session - Add a Book
	- we use ngModel in [()], and angular creates the FormControl object, which represents the form element
2) Reactive Form - preferred over template driven forms
	- we dont use ngModel
	- here we create the FormControl object to represent the form element

Routing in angular
------------------
	- helps to navigate from one component to another component

	- steps for routing - 3 steps
		1) specify the route path for each of your component in app-routing.module.ts file
		2) 2 ways
			a)specify the <a> to route to the component.
				MAKE SURE TO USE routerLink INSTEAD OF href -----> Important, Important, Important
			b) see it tomorrow
		3) specify <router-outlet> tag in the place where you want the components to be displayed
