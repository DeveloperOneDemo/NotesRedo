1) download and install nodejs ----> this is required for npm which in turn is required for installing angular/cli
2) confirm node installation by typing "node --version" in cmd
3) confirm the version of npm by typing "npm --version" in cmd
4) we are ready to install angular, type "npm install -g @angular/cli" in cmd, 
		confirm the installation by typing "ng --version"
5) now that we have the ng command use it to create an angular project in cmd
	- navigate to the folder where you want to create the angular project
	- type the command "ng new <projectname>"
	- choose y for angular routing and CSS for stylesheets
	- now the angular project is created
6) after creating the angular project , open the project in vs code
7) to start angular live development server of the project(so u have to be 
					inside the project folder to start the server), in cmd type
	ng serve 
	(or)
	ng serve --open


in angular we are working with typescript, the files have extension .ts
these .ts files are converted to .js

steps to work with components
----------------------------
1) create the component
2) make an entry of the component in app.module.ts
3) use the selector of the component


creating a component in angular
--------------------------------
1) Manually create the files - tedious

2) use "ng generate component" command - convinient
	- the four files are created - component.ts, component.html, component.css, component-spec.ts
	- we can skip step 2




String interpolation - {{ }}
	- when we wanted to render a property of component class in the template
	- this is also one way property binding

property binding 
	- one way property binding - []
		- when we wanted to render a property of component class in the value of an form element
	- two way property binding - [()]
		- when we want to render a property of component class int the value of a form element and vice versa
		- ngModel is an angular directive and it is available in the module FormsModule, so include FormsModule in the import section of AppModule in app.module.ts

event binding - ()
	- when we wanted to bind an event of the template to a function in the component class




There are 2 ways to bring in boostrap
-------------------------------------
1) we can install bootstrap using npm, bootstrap libraries will get added to the node_modules
2) we can use Bootstrap CDN(Content Delivery Network)
