Input - process/logic - Output

Layered Architecture - 3 tier architecture
--------------------

purpose of layered architecture is loose coupling, 
we dont want the project to be tightly coupled


input/output - presentation layer
process/logic - bussiness logic/service layer
Data access - DAO(Data Access Object) layer

book management system

we will use collections in DAO layer to store the data
later we will shift to databases

POJO - Plain Old Java Object, TO - Transfer Objects, VO - Value Object

class BookPojo{
	private String bookTitle;
	private String bookAuthor;
	private String bookGenre;
	private int bookCost;
	private String bookImageUrl;

	//constructors
	//public getters/setters
	//toString
}
