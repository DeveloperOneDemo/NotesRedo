input - process/logic - output

data
 - we store it in variables

single variable -  single data
int mark = 50;

arrays - hold group of similar data
int[] myMarks = {20,30,40};

collections 

- hold a group of objects
- the object could be of different type
- a collection grows and shrinks as you keep adding and removing objects
- all collection apis are availablke in java.util package
- different collections are avaible based on our requirement

List - indexed, maintains the same order, allows duplicate values
Set - Not indexed, does not maintain the same order, does not allow duplicate value

CRUD
C- Create
R- Read
U- Update
D- Delete

ArrayList , Vector, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet

1) what happens when you print an object of a user defined class on console? - it calls the toString method implicitly
2) is there a way to print meaningful info while printing an object on the console? - yes by oeveriding the toString method
3) We know that packages have to be imported when we use an API from that package, why did we not import java.lang package
	when we were working with String or System or Integer? - the java.lang package is by default imported
