Rules
-----
1) Identifiers(name of a class, variable, method) should be meaningful, no single letter identifiers unless they are running variables
2) naming conventions to be strictly followed
	variables and methods - camel cased eg. mathMark , findArea()
	class - title cased eg. BankAccount, Laptop, Book, SamsungMobile
3) Code has to be formatted/aligned
4) Code should be neat and presentable.


flow control constructs
-----------------------

if variants
	- simple if
	- if else
	- else if ladder
	- nested if

switch case

break - explore how to use in loops and its use cases
continue - explore how to use in loops and its use cases

loops
-----

while loop
do...while loop
for loop
enhanced for loop


three things
-------------
1) intial value
2) a condition 
3) expression which always works to take u one step closer to making the condition false


programs - logic/process should be in seperate methods
--------
1) print the greater of 2 numbers
2) print the greatest of 3 numbers
3) print if a number is even or odd
4) print odd numbers upto N
5) print the factorial of a number
	5! is 5*4*3*2*1
6) print if a number is prime or not
	5 is prime
	7 is prime
	8 is not prime
	12 is not prime
7) print the sum of the digits of a number
	567 means output should be 18 ( 5+6+7)
8) print the fibonacci series upto N
	0 1 1 2 3 5 8...




print odd numbers upto N
